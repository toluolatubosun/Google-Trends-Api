# Google-Trends-Api
A light weight node JS Rest Api. Made for a php site I am working on that needed to use the npm google trends api package

----------------------------------------------

Note:
This is a very basic Api. A lot of functionalites were not added because the api is literally calling another npm Package API.

I may make this a full api in the future.

----------------------------------------------------

Setup:

> npm install

> npm start
